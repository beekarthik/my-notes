\subsection{Lecture 6}

Unfortunately, I didn't transcribe this lecture, as I was very tired.
Here is one of the more important results.

In general $X_n \to X \not\implies \E{X_n} \to \E{X}$. However, Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) and
Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT) provide sufficient conditions in the following form.

\begin{theorem}[Continuous Tail Sum Formula]
    Let $X \geq 0$ be a non-negative random variable with $\E{X} < \infty$. Then,
    \[ \E{X} = \int_0^{\infty} \Pr{X > x} \dd{x} \]
\end{theorem}
