\subsection{Lecture 1}

This lecture I did not have a laptop yet, so I was unable to transcribe anything.
Here is what I remember was discussed:

\begin{definition} [Conditional Probability]
    For two events $A, B$, the probability of $A$ given $B$ is:
    \[ \Pr{A \mid B} = \frac{\Pr{A \cap B}}{\Pr{B}}  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} [MAP]
    We say the Most likely A Posteriori (MAP) estimate of a random variable $X$ given $Y=y$, is:
    \[ \argmax_x \Pr{X=x \mid Y=y} \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} [MLE]
    We say the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of a random variable $X$ given $Y$, is:
    \[ \argmax_x \Pr{Y=y \mid X=x} \]
\end{definition}
\endinput
