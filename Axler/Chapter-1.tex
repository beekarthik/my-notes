\section{Vector Spaces}

\subsection{$\R^n$ and $\C^n$}

\begin{definition}
    $\R$ denotes the field of real numbers.
\end{definition}
    
Some nonconstant polynomials with real coefficients have no real zeroes.
Example: the equation:
\[ x^2 + 1 = 0\]
has no real solutions. Thus, we invent a solution
called $i$, such that $i^2 = -1$.

\begin{definition} Complex Numbers
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A complex number is an ordered pair $(a, b)$, where $a, b \in \R$, but we will write this as $a+bi$.
        \item The set of all complex numbers is denoted by $\C$:
            \[ \C = \{a+bi : a, b \in \R\} \]
        \item Addition and multiplication on $\C$ are defined as follows
        \[ (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c)+(b+d)i \]
        \[ (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i \]
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
    If $a \in \R$, we identify $a+0i$ with the real number $a$.
    Thus we think of $\R$ as a subset of $\C$. We also usually write
    $0+bi$ as just $bi$, and we usually write $0+1i$ as just $i$. From
    the definition of multiplication above, we have that $i^2 = -1$.
\end{note}

\begin{note} 
    Properties of Complex Arithmetic: $\forall \alpha, \beta \in \C$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Commutativity
        \[ \alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha \text{ and } \alpha \beta = \beta \alpha\]
        \item Associativity
        \[ (\alpha + \beta) + \lambda = \alpha + (\beta + \lambda) \text{ and } (\alpha\beta)\lambda = \alpha(\beta \lambda) \]
        \item Identities
        \[ \lambda + 0 = \lambda \text{ and } \lambda 1 = \lambda \]
        \item Additive Inverse
        \begin{center}
           For every $\alpha \in \C$ there exists a unique $\beta \in \C$ such that $\alpha + \beta = 0$ 
        \end{center}
        \item Multiplicative Inverse
        \begin{center}
            For every  $\alpha \in \C \setminus \{0\}$, there exists a unique $\beta \in \C$ such that $\alpha \beta = 1$ 
        \end{center}
        \item Distributivity
        \[ \lambda(\alpha + \beta) = \lambda \alpha + \lambda \beta \]
    \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{definition}
    $\mathbb{F}$ denotes either $\R$ or $\C$
\end{definition}
Elements of $\mathbb{F}$ are sometimes called scalars.
We call it $\mathbb{F}$ because those are both fields.

\begin{definition} Simple Lists
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The set $\R^2$, which you can think of as a plane, is the set of all ordered
        pairs of real numbers:
        \[ \R^2 = \{(x, y) : x, y \in \R\} \]
        \item The set $\R^3$, which you can think of as ordinary space, is the set of all
        ordered triples of real numbers:
        \[ \R^3 = \{(x, y, z) : x, y, z \in \R\} \]
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \textit{list} of \textit{length $n$} is an ordered collection of $n$ numbers
    separated by commas and surrounded by parenthesis. I.e. $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$
    \\
    Two lists are equal if an only if they have the same length and the same elements. 
\end{definition}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(7, 3)$ is a list of length 2. Thus $(7, 3) \in \R^2$.
    \item $(5, 9, -2)$ is a list of length 3. Thus $(5, 9, -2) \in \R^3$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}
    $\F^n$ is the set of all lists of length $n$ of elements of $\F$:
    \[ \F^n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) : x_j \in \F \text{ for } j = 1, \ldots, n\} \]
\end{definition}

Elements of $\F^n$ are often called \textit{points} or \textit{vectors}. 

Does not matter if these sets have geometric sense. We can manipulate them algebraically.
This is where the name linear algebra comes from.

\begin{definition}
    Addition in $\F^n$ is defined by adding the corresponding coordinates:
    \[ (x_1, \ldots, x_n) + (y_1, \ldots, y_n) = (x_1+y_1, \ldots, x_n+y_n) \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The product of a number $\lambda \in \F$ and a vector $\F^n$ is defined by
    multiplying each coordinate of the vector by $\lambda$:
    \[\lambda (x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (\lambda x_1, \ldots, \lambda x_n) \] 
\end{definition}

Single letters can denote elements of $\F^n$ efficiently. You can say $x + y = z$ instead of saying e.g.
\[ (x_1, \ldots, x_n) + (y_1, \ldots, y_n) = (z_1, \ldots, z_n) \]

\begin{definition}
    Let 0 denote the list of length $n$ whose coordinates are all 0:
    \[ 0 = (0, \ldots, 0) \]
\end{definition}

It should always be clear from context which 0 you're talking about. For example:
we have the following:
\begin{theorem}
    If $x \in \F^n$, then $0x = 0$.
\end{theorem}

The 0 on the LHS is a scalar in $\F$. The 0 on the RHS is a vector in $\F^n$.

\subsection{Definition of a Vector Space}

The motivation for the definition of a vectors space comes from the
properties of addition and scalar multiplication in $\F^n$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition is commutative, associative, and has an identity.
    \item Every element has an additive inverse.
    \item Scalar multiplication is associative.
    \item Scalar multiplication by 1 acts as expected.
    \item Addition and scalar multiplication are connected by distributive properties.
\end{itemize}

First, let us define what addition/scalar multiplication is.
\begin{definition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An \textit{addition} on a set $V$ is a function that assigns an element $u + w \in V$ to each pair of elements $u, w \in V$
        \item A \textit{scalar multiplication} on a set $V$ is a function that assigns an element $\lambda u \in V$ to each $\lambda \in \F$ and each $u \in V$
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Suppose $V$ is the set of real valued functions on the interval $[0, 1]$.
    For $f, g \in V$ and $\lambda \in \R$, define $f + g$ and $\lambda f$ by:
    \[ (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) \]
    and
    \[ (\lambda f)(x) = \lambda f(x) \]
    Thus $f + g \in V$ and $\lambda f \in V$.
\end{example}

Now, we can define a vector space $V$. These are based off the
properties of $\F^n$:

\begin{definition}
    A \textit{vector space} is a set $V$ along with an addition on $V$ and a
    scalar multiplication on $V$ such that the following properties hold:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $u + w = w + u$ for all $u, w \in V$
        \item $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)$ and $(ab)u = a(bu)$ for all $u, v, w \in V$ and all $a, b \in \F$
        \item There exists $0 \in V$ such that $u + 0 = u$ for all $u \in V$
        \item For every $u \in V$, there exists $w \in V$ such that $u + w = 0$
        \item 1$u = u$ for all $u \in V$
        \item $a (u + w) = au + aw$ and $(a+b)u = au + bu$ for all $a, b \in \F$ and all $u, w \in V$
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example} Vector Spaces:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\F^n$ with the usual operations of addition and scalar multiplications is a vector space.
        \item $\F^\infty$ is defined to be the set of all sequences of elements of $\F$:
        \[ \{(x_1, x_2, \ldots) : x_j \in \F \text{for } j = 1, 2, \ldots \} \]
        Addition and scalar multiplication are also defined coordinate-wise. This is also a vector space.
        \item More generally, if $S$ is a set, let $F^S$ denote the set of functions from $S$ to $\F$.
        For $f, g \in \F^S$, the sum $f + g \in \F^S$ is the function defined by:
        \[ (f + g)(x)  = f(x) + g(x)\]
        for all $x \in S$.
        For $\lambda \in \F$ and $f \in \F^S$, the product $\lambda f \in \F^S$ is the function defined by
        \[ (\lambda f)(x) = \lambda f(x) \]
        for all $x \in S$.
        With these definitions, $\F^S$ becomes a vector space.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

Our first theorem then follows:

\begin{theorem}
    If $V$ is a vector space, $\forall u \in V$, $0u = 0$.
    \begin{proof*}
    For arbitrary $u \in V$, we have:
    \begin{align*}
        0u &= (0 + 0)u \\
        &= 0u + 0u
    \end{align*}
    Adding the additive inverse of $0u$, denoted $-0u$, to both sides of the equation
    above gives:
    \begin{align*}
        0u + (-0u) &= 0u + 0u + (-0u) \\
        0 = 0u
    \end{align*}
    as desired. \qed
    \end{proof*}

\end{theorem}
